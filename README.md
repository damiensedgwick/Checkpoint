# Checkpoint - Work Session Tracker

A quick and dirty macOS menu bar app built with SwiftUI that helps you track your work sessions and maintain productivity through timed checkpoints.

## !IMPORTANT

v2.0.0 is probably not backwards compatible with v1.2.0. I am unsure if saved logs will still be visible so it is probably worth taking a screenshot
of them before installing the new version if you need to reference them.

## Installation

1. Download the latest DMG from the releases page
2. Double click the DMG file to install the application
3. Drag the application into your Applications
4. Click to open

If you get a security warning, accept it, you will need to go into your privacy and security settings to say that you are happy to open
the app anyway.
