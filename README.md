# Checkpoint


A quick and dirty macOS app built using Swift and SwiftUI that helps you
track your work and maintain productivity through logging your work at
set intervals.

## macOS 26 (Beta)

⚠️ There should be no breaking changes with your existing data, however to
be safe, it is recommended to go to settings and export your existing data
before installing and upgrading to the v2.0.0-beta release. This will be in
a JSON format and will ensure that your data is not lost. If there are any
issues please open one using GitHub and I will do my best to resolve it. An
import feature is currently being worked on to remedy any problems. Installing
the previous release should mean your logs are usuable just as they were before ⚠️

1. Download the beta release [v2.0.0-beta](https://github.com/damiensedgwick/Checkpoint/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta)
